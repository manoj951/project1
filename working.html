<h2>How Does the Quadcoptor Work?</h2>
<h4>The frame provides the structure and rigidity and it's where all the components will be mounted. The flight controller manipulates the RPM of the individual motors in response to the user's input. If you tell it to go forward, the flight controller will adjust the RPM of the rear motors. <br/>
The ESCs take the signals from the flight controller and adjust the speed of the motors. The motors and propellers provide the thrust and the lift for your DIY quadcopter. The battery provides the power to all the components. The radio (transmitter and receiver) allows you to control the movements of the quadcopter.</h4>

<h2>How GPS works</h2>
<h4>
GPS satellites circle the Earth twice a day in a precise orbit. Each satellite transmits a unique signal and orbital parameters that allow GPS devices to decode and compute the precise location of the satellite. GPS receivers use this information and trilateration to calculate a user's exact location. Essentially, the GPS receiver measures the distance to each satellite by the amount of time it takes to receive a transmitted signal. With distance measurements from a few more satellites, the receiver can determine a user's position and display it.

To calculate your 2-D position (latitude and longitude) and track movement, a GPS receiver must be locked on to the signal of at least 3 satellites. With 4 or more satellites in view, the receiver can determine your 3-D position (latitude, longitude and altitude). Generally, a GPS receiver will track 8 or more satellites, but that depends on the time of day and where you are on the earth.<br/><br/>

Once your position has been determined, the GPS unit can calculate other information, such as:

<h4>-Speed<br/>
-Bearing<br/>
-Track<br/>
-Trip dist<br/>
-Distance to destination</h4>

<h2>Connection of gps module with nodemcu</h2>
<pre><h4>Step 1: Ingredients <br/>	
1. You'll need an ESP8266 - e12 wifi module

3. A Ublox 6m GPS receiver

4. Some jumper wires<h4></pre>

<pre><h4>Step 2: Hooking It Up<br/>
1. First place the ESP8266 with GPS

2. Connect a jumper wire from the Ground and Output VCC of the ESP to the power and ground rails of GPS unit.

3. Connect the TX pin of the GPS to the D6 pin of the ESP, and connect the RX pin of the GPS to the D7 pin of the ESP. <br>
These are your Serial communication pins. 

Step 3: Upload the Code

First, install the Arduino IDE into the NodeMcu and install all the necessary libraries such as: TinyGPS plus, Software Serial.<br/>
Also install all the necessary drivers for your computer to recognize the ESP8266.<br/>
Compile it and upload to your NodeMcu esp-12e.<br/>
Gain the values of latitude and longitude into the area of code "gps.location.lat())" and "gps.location.lng())" 
</h4></pre>
<h2>Area calculation using php</h2>
<pre><h4>1. Intake the latitude and longitude values.<br/>
2. Calculate the distances between each point.<br/>
3. Calculate of area using sides of the triangle(Heron's formula).
